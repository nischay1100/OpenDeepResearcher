In **September 2025**, 8.6% of its total vehicle sales (37,113 units) were EVs, equating to an estimated **3,192 EV units**. This placed Mahindra as a significant player, particularly as it was noted to be \"closing in on Tata\" by **May 2025**, indicating its growing market presence and competitive offering (likely driven by models like the XUV400).\n",
